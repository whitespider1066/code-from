# Sqlite3 and Python

This code goes with the (Sqlite3 and Python)[] post over on the blog.

It's example code to demonstrate connecting to an sqlite3 database in python and running sql against it.

I do not have a copy of the Northwind database here. Links to get a copy can be found on the blog post.
