# code-from
Code etc in support of the blog https://codefrom.wordpress.com

The blog "Code From" is a blog I started to help computing lecturers at FE who are teaching vocational courses such as BTEC or OCR, particularly the programming and game design units.

This GitHub repository is the home of code (and other files) that I have written for my lessons and used in the blog posts.

I hope that these files and blog posts have helped some-one.
